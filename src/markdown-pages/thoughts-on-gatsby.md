### Just Sharing Some Initial Thoughts on GatsbyJS.

So far, I'm quite liking all of the tools and plugins available for building websites with GatsbyJS!

I've started building my developer portfolio site using Gatsby as well, and I hope to publish the first version of the site very soon. Stay tuned for that!
